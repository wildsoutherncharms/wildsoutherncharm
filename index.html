      <h4>About Us!</h4>
      <p>Hey everyone, thanks for making the journey to Wild Southern Charm! So, a little about WSC and this all
        started. When I was in high school, and decided to cook dinner for the family. I decided to reach out past
        my normal comfort zone of grilled cheeses and the usual breakfast food, and make Chicken Franchise. I worked
        and worked hard that fine evening, hoping to impress the family. It came to that time to serve them the
        dinner, and a funny story, I failed miserable. It was so under cooked and down right bad. This hindered me
        to the point where I did not want to cook anymore. Lets fast forward some odd years later, and let me tell
        you why I fell in love with cooking all over again. I ended up joining the Navy in hopes of figuring out what
        I wanted to do with my life and supporting my lovely baby girl. I ended up getting medically retired and once
        again without a clue of what I wanted to do with my life. So, I turned to something that I knew I loved to
        do, but did not have the overall know how of what to do, Cooking. I ended up going to the Art Institute for
        Culinary in Atlanta, Georgia. From there I was hooked. I received my Associates, as well as a Bachelor's of
        Arts. Its safe to say, from my first mistake to now, my cooking skills have greatly improved. Enough about
        me though, lets dive into what this site is all about. Wild Southern Charm is all about creating wonderful
        food and sharing it with the world, as well as creating amazing products that are substantial. Besides
        food, WSC is hand picking and creating beautiful wood pieces for manganic knife boards, knife holders,
        and other projects. WSC is also creating other craft pieces for numerous items for the home to help create
        the rustic look.

        <h5>Magnetic Knife Boards</h5>
        <img src="/images/IMG_3600.JPG" class="productImg">
        <p>Keep your knives presentable, sharp, and out of the way with this magnetic wood knife board. Designed with
          simplicity and beauty in mind, our wooden knife board are made to sit complete flat against a wall with no
          screws or magnets visible. Every Wild Southern Charm knife board are a one of a kind pieces. There will not
          be another exactly like it. However, there may be some close to it, as this Cedar wood is unique to its
          location and former use. We will find wood that has similar markings and colorations and create “runs” of
          these very special finds. <br><br>
          - Embedded with super strong rare earth magnets allowing you to space your knives out as you like.
          Each magnetic knife holder is finished with food grade mineral oil to protect your knives and the
          holder from environmental contaminates and condition for several days. The magnets used are 100% recycled
          rare earth magnets.
          <br><br>

        <h5>Important Magnet Safety Warning!</h5>
        <p>
          Neodymium magnets are used inside of our products and are very strong. These are very powerful magnets. Do not take them lightly!
          Handling them with care is necessary to prevent personal injuries, property damages and magnet damages.
          1. Don’t break apart the knife rack to get the magnets. Neodymium magnets are brittle; they can be broken or can splinter in a collision. One should wear gloves and protective glasses when handling these magnets, because splinters could disengage and fly from the magnets.
          2. Normal Neodymium magnets will lose their magnetic properties if heated above 175°F (80° C). So don’t put this thing in the oven.
          3. What you hear about magnets and electronics is true. Keep them away from your phone and computers. The strong magnetic fields of neodymium magnets can damage items such as television, computer monitors, credit cards, bank cards, computers, diskettes and other data carriers, video tapes, mechanical watches, hearing aids, loud speakers and VCRs. Pace-makers may be damaged or switch to "Test Mode" in the presence of a strong magnetic force, if a pace-maker is in use, keep a minimum of 3 feet distance.
          4. Under no circumstances should you try to cut, saw or drill the Neodymium magnets that are inside our products! Not only would the magnet break, but also the resulting dust from the magnet is very flammable. Neodymium magnets should never be burned, as burning them will create toxic fumes.</p>
